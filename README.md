# Bienvenido al workshop de containers en AWS

## 1) It's all about containers!

We will walk you through the very basics of containers: from installing and configuring Docker in your machine, running containers locally, till finally deploying them in AWS.

## 2) If you are using a Windows machine (srsly?)

We strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even tested in Windows environments.

## 3) This is not everything we have for today. There's more!

You know that thing called Kubernetes? I bet you kow. Be ready, because there's also an amazing lab waiting for you. This lab will start at 3PM and it's going to be nuts!

## 4) Enough of jibber jabber...

Go sharp your Container skills and take over the world.
