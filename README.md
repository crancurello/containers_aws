# Bienvenido al workshop de containers en AWS

## 1) It's all about containers!

We will walk you through the very basics of containers: from installing and configuring Docker in your machine, running containers locally, till finally deploying them in AWS.

## 2) If you are using a Windows machine, we strongly recommend you to spin up a Linux EC2 instance. None of these labs were even tested in Windows environments.

## 3) Please, run this lab in the exactly order as follows:

* [1. Setup Environments](https://github.com/crancurello/containers_aws/tree/master/01-SetupEnvironment)

* [2. Creating Your Docker Image](https://github.com/crancurello/containers_aws/tree/master/02-CreatingDockerImage)

* [3. Running An ECS Cluster](https://github.com/crancurello/containers_aws/tree/master/03-DeployEcsCluster)

* [4. Deploying An Application with AWS Fargate](https://github.com/crancurello/containers_aws/tree/master/04-DeployFargate)

* [5. Deploying a Kubernetes Cluster with KOPS](https://github.com/crancurello/containers_aws/tree/master/05-DeployKubernetes)
