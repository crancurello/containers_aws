# Setup Environments

This section describes the hardware and software needed for this workshop, and how to configure them. This workshop is designed for a BYOL (Brying Your Own Laptop) style hands-on-lab.

## Hardware & Software

- Memory: At least 4 GB+, strongly preferred 8 GB
- Operating System: Mac OS X (10.10.3+), Windows 10 Pro+ 64-bit, Ubuntu 12+, CentOS 7+.

> NOTE: An older version of the operating system may be used. The installation instructions would differ slightly in that case and are explained in the next section.

## Install Docker

Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows and Linux. This lab will use https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download (Docker Community Edition - CE). Download the Docker CE edition for your machine from the https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community (Docker Store).

> NOTE: Docker CE requires a fairly recent operating system version. If your machine does not meet the requirements, then you need to install https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox (Docker Toolbox).

## Install AWS CLI

During this workshop we will interact with some AWS API's. Having the latest version of the AWS CLI in your computer is appropriated.

Instructions to install the AWS CLI are available here: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html

## Install git

Sometimes will be easier if you just clone this repo, instead of copying the files. Having the git installed is not a mandatory requisite, but it may help you.
