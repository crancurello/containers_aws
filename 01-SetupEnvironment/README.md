## Install Docker

Docker runs natively on Mac, Windows and Linux. This lab will use https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download (Docker Community Edition - CE). Download the Docker CE edition for your machine from the https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community (Docker Store).
